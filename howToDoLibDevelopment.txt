This document is for contributors who will be modifying the pysdn library (rather than samples).
This document walks you through setting up your environment so that you can modify
the python files in pysdn and then run the samples without having to deploy a new version
of pysdn to pypi and then installing it again.  Instead your environment will use your
local pysdn (rather than installed library) so that your changes are used immediately.

1. cd to pysdn
2. python setup.py develop

If you want to 'undo' this you can:
1. cd to pysdn
2. python setup.py develop --uninstall

To check current pysdn being used:
1. pip list | grep pysdn
